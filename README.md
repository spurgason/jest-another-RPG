## Description
This is a command-line turn-based game using Node.js. This project emphasizes the use of practices such as Test-driven development (**TDD**) and Object-oriented programming (**OOP**). The user will start by invoking the program using `node app.js`. Once the program initializes the player will be shown their inventory and stats and will be asked to decide to "***Attack*** or "***Use Potion***' if their agility stat is higher than the enemy's. If the user chooses to attack then health will be deducted from the enemy as well as the player because the enemy will take their turn after the user. The user will fight through several rounds until the user or enemy is defeated. If the user prevailed in the first battle they will get a potion from their defeated opponent. The user will then go on to fight until they defeat all other enemies or are defeated.
